# Shelter Task Scheduler

This is a Java-based program my ENSF 380 group and I designed to generate a daily list of tasks for volunteers to support the animals in residence at the Animal Rescue Center. This program efficiently schedules tasks for the care and well-being of medium-sized animals, including coyotes, foxes, porcupines, beavers, and raccoons. It optimizes task allocation, groups similar tasks, and creates a schedule for an entire day. This application prioritizes the care and support of animals at the Animal Rescue Center, ensuring that tasks are completed promptly and effectively. This program is a valuable tool for rescue centers that specialize in medium-sized animals and aim to optimize their daily operations.


## Features

Task Assignment: The program assigns tasks with no flexibility, ensuring that all essential responsibilities are covered.

Optimized Scheduling: Remaining tasks are scheduled efficiently, grouping similar tasks together when possible to save time and resources.

Full-Day Schedule: The scheduler generates a schedule for an entire day, making it easy for volunteers to plan their activities.

Database Integration: The program integrates with a database updated by the staff vet throughout the day to keep track of required medical tasks.

GUI Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) displays the schedule and allows users to interact with it intuitively.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using the Shelter Rescue Scheduler, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

Java Development Kit (JDK): You need the Java Development Kit installed on your computer. You can download it from oracle.com.

Database Connection: Ensure that the program has access to the EWR database, which is updated throughout the day by the staff vet.
